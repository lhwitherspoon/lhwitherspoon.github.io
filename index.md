# Tech consultant and science advocate helping you get your message out.
My focus is on helping small-to-medium organizations carry out their mission by helping them utilize technology in a way that works for them. With a background in healthcare and website development, I provide a variety of services:
- Initial assessment of organizational needs and resources;
- Evaluation of how (and whether) current technology can meet those needs;
- Legacy technology assessment and evaluation of potential paths (upgrade? replace? maintain?)
- Website services including website maintenance, hosted server maintenance, troubleshooting, making those calls to your hosting company to find out what is going on and get it resolved. 
- Initial evaluation of content needs and site structure;
- Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, Google Search Console: initial setup, report setup based on your organization's data needs, report interpretation.
Technical interests: a variety, but include web development, UX, and accessibility together. Health interests: Pro-vaccine advocacy, the impact of socioeconomic inequity and injustice on health, and public health in general.
